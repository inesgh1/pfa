this is my end of year project , I've worked with logistic regression to predict wethen the user of our android application is in risk of a heart attack or not
I've used the genrated heart beat measured with the sensor that the user wil wear it as a watch.I've used flask to deploy my ML model and heroku to deploy it and heroku to deploy it online so the android application can get and send data from/to the model.
